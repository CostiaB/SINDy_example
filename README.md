# SINDy_example
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) is an algorithm to discover governing dynamical equations for time series  ùê±(ùë°) .

The key idea is to construct a differential equation:

$$\frac{d{\bf x}}{d t} = \Theta({\bf x}^T) {\bf x}$$
or like this:
$$\frac{d{\bf x}}{d t^2} = \Theta({\bf x}^T) {\bf x}$$
if we are looking for a second-order derivative.

where the time derivative is computed from the time series data and Œò(ùê±) is a non-linear basis.

We will follow the next steps:
Steps:

Compute time derivative: Perhaps the trickiest part, especially for noisy time series although one can use total variation regularized derivatives for such cases as here
  
Choose basis: We will choose a non-linear basis constructed from the time series data, consisting of a polynomial basis and trigonometrical functions.  
  
Use regression: We apply regularized linear regression Lasso/Ridge with one step or we can perform sequential thresholding least squares [1].
  

Once we discover the underlying dynamical equations, it will be a lot easier to forecast becomes.

Next moves:

In reality, it is difficult to know the right coordinates and basis functions to use. The interesting extension of SINDy so far has been to use latent basis / coordinates instead of physical space basis. In latent space,

$$ {\bf x} \longrightarrow {\bf z} = Encoder({\bf x})$$

A non-linear basis in ùê≥ is used to perform SINDy. The full cost function also takes into account the physical space SINDy expression. 
This approach is developed in articles [2] and [3]
